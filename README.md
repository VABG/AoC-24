UI for Advent Of Code

It requires the session cookie from your login to Advent Of Code to run properly.
The UI can run independently of your code project.

Currently breakpoints/attaching to process in the built project containing the code for the days doesn't work after I added the possibility to reload the .dll.

Features:
Automatic parsing of days from code
Pixel drawer
Log
Puzzle description in UI
Ability to run tests in UI

How to use:
- Build AdventOfCode_24 solution
- Run and set up Cookie and Build location in UI
- Use the problems solution or create your own and reference an up-to-date AdventOfCodeCore.dll
- Build and press refresh to see your Days

See my crappy solutions for samples of general use
